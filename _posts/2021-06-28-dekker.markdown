<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Declarative sentences can be used to state or stage two types of
propositions. The distinction between the two helps in clarifying
so-called subjective discourse. It also urges a novel conception of
what a truly dynamic semantics might have to look like.
