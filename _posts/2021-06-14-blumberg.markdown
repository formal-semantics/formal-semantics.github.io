<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper develops a semantic theory of redundancy by positing a
redundancy operator R that can be inserted locally and optionally into
logical form. Rp says that p is true and that p is not redundant in its
local context, i.e. p is true somewhere but not everywhere in its local
context. This operator explains a variety of phenomena, including
diversity constraints, ignorance inferences, and free choice.
