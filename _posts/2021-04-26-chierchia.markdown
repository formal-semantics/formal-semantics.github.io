<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There	is	increasing	consensus	on	the idea	that	certain	sentences	perceived	
as	“ungrammatical” owe	their	status	not	to	being	syntactically	ill-formed,	but	to
their	being	L(ogically)-determinate and	hence	informationally	trivial.	Clearly,	
however,	not	every	L-determinate	sentence is	perceived	as	ungrammatical,	which	
raises	the	question	of	whether	there	is	a principled	way	of	sifting	among	the	L-determinate	
sentences those	that	give	rise to	ungrammaticality	from	those	that	do	
not.	Several	interesting	attempts	have	been	made	in	this	connection	(Gajewski, Del	
Pinal),	which, however,	we	argue	fall	short	of	the	task.	We	propose	a	modification	
and	generalization	of	such	proposals	based on	the	notion	of	‘modulation’ of	what	are	
termed	‘the	referential	points’ of	sentences	(i.e.	their non	logical	vocabulary	and	
their	variables).	This	approach	has	far	reaching	consequences	for	our	understanding	
of	the	divide	between logical	and	non	logical	vocabulary	and	for	the	very	notion	of	
semantic	competence.
