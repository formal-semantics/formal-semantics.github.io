<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We propose a modification of the exhaustivity operator from Fox 2007
that on top of negating all the Innocently Excludable alternatives affirms all the ‘Innocently Includable’ ones. The main result of supplementing the notion of Innocent
Exclusion with that of Innocent Inclusion is that it allows the exhaustivity operator to identify cells in the partition induced by the set of alternatives (assign a truth
value to every alternative) whenever possible. We argue for this property of ‘cell identification’ based on the simplification of disjunctive antecedents and the effects on
free choice that arise as the result of the introduction of universal quantifiers. We
further argue for our proposal based on the interaction of only with free choice disjunction.
