<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In “Must …stay …strong!” (von Fintel and Gillies 2010), we set out to slay a dragon, or
rather what we called The Mantra: that epistemic *must* has a modal force weaker than
expected from standard modal logic, that it doesn’t entail its prejacent, and that the best
explanation for the evidential feel of *must* is a pragmatic explanation. We argued that
all three sub-mantras are wrong and offered an explanation according to which *must* is
strong, entailing, and the felt indirectness is the product of an evidential presupposition
carried by epistemic modals. Mantras being what they are, it is no surprise that each
of the sub-mantras have been given new defenses. Here we offer them new problems
and update our picture, concluding that *must* is (still) strong.
