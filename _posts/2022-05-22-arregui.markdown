<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper investigates the interaction between quantifiers and epistemic
modals, focusing on the contrast between every and any. It builds on observations
made in von Fintel & Iatridou (2003), who noted that quantifiers seem unable to take
wide scope across an epistemic modal. The proposal at the heart of the paper is that
modes of epistemic access to domains of quantification play a role in accounting for
apparent restrictions on scope. The paper takes the characterization of conceptual
covers in Aloni (2001) as a starting point to argue that in the context of epistemic
modals, constraints on epistemic access to the domain of quantification can give rise
to scope illusions.
