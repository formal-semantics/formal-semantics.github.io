<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper focuses on some non-indicative uses of indicative sentences. Declarative uses are argued to resist an analysis that is based on the idea of an
underlying proposition, as it is traditionally construed in linguistics and philosophy. It is argued that a certain type of evaluative discourse is also of such
a non-propositional type. The mere acknowledgment of this fact helps clarifying the kind faultless disagreements that philosopher and linguists have
been struggling with.
