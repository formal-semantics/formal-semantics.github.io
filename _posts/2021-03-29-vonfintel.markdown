<b> ABSTRACT: </b>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In “Must …stay …strong!” (von Fintel and Gillies 2010), we set out to slay a dragon, or
rather what we called The Mantra: that epistemic must has a modal force weaker than
expected from standard modal logic, that it doesn’t entail its prejacent, and that the best
explanation for the evidential feel of must is a pragmatic explanation. We argued that
all three sub-mantras are wrong and offered an explanation according to which must is
strong, entailing, and the felt indirectness is the product of an evidential presupposition
carried by epistemic modals. Mantras being what they are, it is no surprise that each
of the sub-mantras have been given new defenses. Here we offer them new problems
and update our picture, concluding that must is (still) strong.
